# php-uni-project-2019

A half-baked object-oriented-styled PHP project of mine in uni. **TL;DR: While they asked students to build their apps object-oriented (hinting towards uding Java) I refused and made an object-oriented-styled PHP project instead.** It was meant to be a group project but I just had to do everything myself, so I finished all the functionality requirements, and made the front-end of the app horrible as a website from the early 2000s (and now I'm learning to become a front-end dev, it's a long story). 

Although I'm no longer using PHP (for now), I'm uploading the source code mainly to promote my GitHub account. And perhaps one day I could find any of this useful..
